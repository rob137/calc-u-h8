## TODO

- Add Prettier and ESLint. âœ…
- Screen: âœ…
  - Display numbers entered. âœ…
  - Accept combinations like `001`, `100111` and `22378008`. âœ…
- Operations: âœ…
  - `+` or `-` should result in the number being pushed to a 'mathematical stack' [MS is presumably a pair of numbers - aggregate and next number], and then another number can be added. âœ…
  - `AC` clears the stack & screen. âœ…
  - Clicking the `=` would then add/subtract the number with the previous number in the stack. âœ…
  - Using the `=` will trigger the `-` or `+` of the previous numbers in the stack, and push the answer into the stack and show it on the screen. âœ…
- Then: âœ…
  - Layout. âœ…
  - Shared colors - numbers, operations, equals. âœ…
  - Styles - once over on current layout: âœ…
    - Cursor. âœ…
    - Proper buttons. âœ…
    - Prevent selection of button text. âœ…
    - Separate calculator border / background. âœ…
    - Center and resize text. âœ…
    - Buttons perhaps square, no padding, hover / active colors. âœ…
    - Contrasting color for equals. âœ…
    - Font pairing (header + buttons). âœ…
    - Colors - background gradient to match equals? âœ…
  - Help widget, or title text on buttons? âœ…
  - ðŸ¥š âœ…
  - Change links to buttons. âœ…
  - Keyboard keys for all (0-9 + - =, and AC/CE can be 'backspace'). âœ…
